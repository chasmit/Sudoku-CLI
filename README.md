# Sudoku
Messing around with Ruby.  These are sudoku solvers that run on a command line interface, working on an input file of characters representing the puzzle.  Blank spaces in the puzzle are represented by a period. See sample file 'string'.  

CLI Usage: ./sudoku.rb <filename>
 
I might make a friendlier interface one day.

sudoku.rb: standard 9x9 sudoku solver. Supports puzzles with character ranges [1-9], [a-i], and [A-I].

sudoku_remix.rb: 16x16 sudoku solver.  WIP
